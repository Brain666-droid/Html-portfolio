<h1>Future Plan<h1>
  <p>Alongside learning web development, I’m currently undergoing professional training at an aviation institute to become a male cabin crew member.
It’s a career path that blends communication, service, and confidence — and I’m excited to explore the skies just as much as I explore HTML tags.
Whether it’s 35,000 feet above ground or deep inside VS Code, I believe in staying curious, creative, and ready for anything</p>
